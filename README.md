===================================	

This is an app called "Beer And..." that finds unique craft beers and their food pairings.	

===================================	

Users are able to click a button that returns a random craft beer suggestion	

Users are able to search by beer type to see a selection of beers, information on that beer, and food pairing suggestions	

Users are also able to search by food	

===================================	

Technologies used were HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and AJAX	

The complex user interface module is the modal that pops up upon each search	

PunkApi is the external data source	

Unsplash was my free, open license image source	

===================================	

I am concerned the design for the mobile app may be too busy and may need less images	

I also had to choose between emptying the div for each search query and returning just one answer, or having to refresh the page to start a new search  	

I was going to add the ability to close each search result individually, but decided to leave each close button to close entire modal. I could also have added both.
